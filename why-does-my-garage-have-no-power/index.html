Get shopping advice from experts friends and the community. The power supply the unit is plugged into is fine. The electric company says that because the meter is located on the house - they cannot do anything. Based on the age of your house the garage door opener might not be GFCI protected and that leads me to believe you have a loose connection somewhere. This main breaker exception has been in the code since 1933 and there was a period in the mid-twentieth century when a type of panel called a split bus that utilized that allowance was popular.</p>

<p>Sometimes a garage door wont open or close for one reason only the operator has no power connection. This could leave you and your family unable to drive your car anywhere possibly affecting your entire work schedule until a technician is able to come out. With that being said I was running a circular saw off an outlet in my garage when I lost all power in the garage.

<p>I unplugged it and then tested it to determine that it does not power. Based on the age of your house the garage door opener might not be GFCI protected and that leads me to believe you have a loose connection somewhere. Should be 110 to 120 volts from the breaker leg to the neutral ground if its a single pole breaker or 220 to 240 volts across the two breaker legs if its a two pole.

<p>Circuit breakers may also appear to be intact not tripped but in reality is just sitting in between position. GFCI devices often protect the outlet circuit that is installed into the garage therefore if this device trips off then garage outlets will be affected. If this does not restore power to the receptacles the problem may be a GFCI type receptacle has tripped and needs to be reset.

<p>In the funniest of scenarios the problem will simply be due to an unplugged power cord. I unplugged it and then tested it to determine that it does not power.
