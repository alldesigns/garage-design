<p>If the boat is under 21 feet long including the trailer then it can be put straight in with another room for a vehicle or another boat. If the garage was flat with the driveway I would not have the clearence. Or a Malibu that didnt. For example for a 116 boat on a trailer you might want to go with a garage door dimensions of 12 foot high and at least 10 foot in width.

<p>For example for a 116 boat on a trailer you might want to go with a garage door dimensions of 12 foot high and at least 10 foot in width. This may or may not include the swim platform or anchorbow pulpit if installed. Therefore if your garage is 16 tall you can have up to a 14 tall sectional door. Anyhow because I was warn to stay away from carpet interiors I found that the maxum open bow boats has removable carpet over. Left View 050g 0104 Garage Plans Garage Plan Pool House Plans.</p>
